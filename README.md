# Harvard CS50 Repository

Welcome to my CS50 repository! This repository contains my work, assignments, and projects completed as part of my self-learning journey through the [Harvard CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/) Computer Science course. CS50 is an introduction to computer science concepts and the art of programming.
> As much as this might help you understand the concepts ,
> I sugest that you try and understand the problems yourself and give it a shot.
>> in my view, that is the only way to truly harness the true power of C

## Overview

This repository captures my progress and solutions as I independently learned computer science concepts using the Harvard CS50 curriculum. Each project demonstrates skills and concepts ranging from basic programming to web development.

## Projects

### Lectures

The course includes Lectures that build programming and problem-solving skills step-by-step. Highlights include:

1. **Lecture 2**: C Basics (e.g., Hello, Water, Mario)
2. **Lecture 3**: Arrays and Algorithms (e.g., Caesar, Substitution)
3. **Lecture 4**: Memory Management (e.g., Plurality, Tideman)
4. **Lecture 5**: Data Structures (e.g., Filter, Recover)
5. **Lecture 6**: File I/O and Algorithms (e.g., Speller)
6. **Lecture 7**: Web Development (e.g., Finance)
7. **Lecture 8**: SQL and Advanced Topics (e.g., User Management)

## Languages and Technologies Used

- **C**
